# downbeat: a React-based drum machine

</div>

### downbeat is a compact DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that allows you to quickly create beats using a handful of provided drum samples. The interface is intentially minimal and easy to use: simply add a track, pick a sample, click some nodes, and press play.

#### The app currently features 20 preset samples for you to combine as you wish, including kicks, hihats, snares, and claps, with more samples coming in future updates.

# Getting Started

[Make your first beat with 'downbeat'](https://downbeat-daw.herokuapp.com)

#### In order to access full functionality, users must make a 'downbeat' account. Any credentials will do. This is simply so that you can come back and access your saved projects in the future.

# Features

- Add up to 10 tracks and play them back simultaneously.
- Customize the playback sample for each track.
- Choose between 1-8 beats on which that sample will play, by clicking and unclicking the nodes on that track
- Customize the playback BPM (beats per minute) - hint, in this case each row is considered a beat, so going into the 200-300 range is not outrageous.
- Create, save, delete, and load projects stored in a secure MongoDB database, accessable only by you.
- View all the projects you've created from your 'load project' page, listed in reverse chronological order.
- Don't like the changes you've made since your last save? Simply reload the page! The project will revert to its last saved state.
